[W Hogarth invented and engraved this](https://pollecuttn.github.io/hogarth/)

An experiment with [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/) and [Lazy load plugin for jQuery](http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload).
With help from [beibei2's answer on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21434218/masonry-lazyload-doesnt-want-to-work-together).

Also ended up using [sed](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html) to generate the HTML for all the images, and [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/) and [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.org/) to optimise the images.

And using cc-by images from [Welcome Images](http://wellcomeimages.org/).
